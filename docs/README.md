# nbpages

nbpages is a command line tool for managing a collection of Jupyter notebooks published on
[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). This project was inspired by the tools included with the
[Python Data Science Handbook](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook) by
[Jake Vanderplas](https://github.com/jakevdp).

## Installation

    pip install nbpages

To upgrade a previously installed version to the latest version

    pip install nbpages --upgrade

## Notebook organization

Notebooks are maintained within the `notebooks` directory. Thare are organized into a chapter/section heirarchy
using a filename prefix. Filenames have an `nn.mm-` prefix where`nn` refers to the chapter number or, if a letter, to
an Appendix. The digits `mm` refers to the section number. Section `00` is reserved to hold the chapter title and
any introductory material. The notebooks must also have the usual `.ipynb` suffix.

## Normal usage

Following setup, the normal use of `nbpages` is to execute the command line

    nbpages

from the top level directory of the notebook repository. Normally this command would be between completing edits or
additions to the notebooks and prior to a github commit. The command will

* add or amend headers and navigation bars in all notebooks,
* write a table of contents file
* write a keyword index
* write README.md using the template file

## Utilities

To help achieve a consistent style over a collection of notebooks, use the command

    nbpages --lint

to locate some forms of notebook 'lint'.  A current list of additional features can be found

    nbpages --help
