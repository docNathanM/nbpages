{{ page_title }} provides a Python toolset for managing a github repository of Jupyter notebooks. The project was
inspired by the tools included with the
[Python Data Science Handbook](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook) by
[Jake Vanderplas](https://github.com/jakevdp).

## Installation

    pip install nbpages

## Usage

This package assumes you have already created one or more Jupyter notebooks in a `notebooks` subdirectory. The notebook
file names must be prefaced by an 'dd.dd-' prefix indicating chapter and section numbering.  The direcortory should
published as a github repository.

To use, execute the command line

    python nbpages

from the top level directory of the notebook repository. The will create a directory containing configuration data and
templates for a README.md file and notebook headers.
