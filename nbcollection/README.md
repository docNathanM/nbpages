# nbpages

nbpages is a tool for managing a repository of Jupyter notebooks that comprise a book, course, or other
form of large project. It was inspired by the tools included with the
[Python Data Science Handbook](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook) by 
[Jake Vanderplas](https://github.com/jakevdp).
